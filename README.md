# BasedBot
 Discord Bot that can be used to keep track of Social Credit. Small in scale, probably best used for servers with under 20 people.

To apply +1 Social Credit Score to a user:
React to any message of theirs (that was sent after @BasedBot was connected) with ðŸ˜Ž 

To apply -1 Social Credit Score to a user:
React to any message of theirs (that was sent after @BasedBot was connected) with ðŸ˜¬ 

To check the Social Credit Score of a user, type:
$based @Username 
(For Example: $based @BasedBot)

Notes:
A user cannot change their own Social Credit Score.
Please try to avoid spamming reactions on every message of a user just because, it makes it harder to accurately gauge their basedituity.
